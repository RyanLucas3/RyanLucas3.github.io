I am a PhD Student at The Operations Research Center at MIT, supervised by Rahul Mazumder. I am interested in discrete and continuous optimization, and their applications in deep learning and high-dimensional statistics. 

Research Interests
======
I am interested broadly in the use of modern optimization in ML applications. I have worked thus far on designing more efficient and robust deep learning models via optimization.
