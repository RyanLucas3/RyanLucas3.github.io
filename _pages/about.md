I am a third year PhD Student at The Operations Research Center at MIT, where I am fortunate to be supervised by Rahul Mazumder. 

Research Interests
======
I am interested broadly in the use of mathematical optimization methods (first/second-order methods, mixed-integer programming, robust optimization) in deep learning and high-dimensional statistics.
